                     <h3>Abstract</h3>
                     <p>With the popularity of the Internet, more and more applications and systems are being deployed
                        on the Internet for people to use. However, leakage of user information occurs from time to time
                        due to the system loopholes and network attacks. Therefore, more and more users are paying
                        attention to the security, privacy and reliability of the online system. By solving users' pain
                        points, it can attract more users to use eSystems.

                     <h3>I.INTRODUCTION</h3>
                     <p>Nowadays, much more eSystems are used to complete our daily works. However, there are many
                        reports about the leak of user info of some website and applications, which has deepened the
                        user's distrust of the eSystems[1]. There was more than 50 million users of Facebook information
                        has been leaked[2]. It is essential that improved the security of the eSystems and protected the
                        privacy of end-users. This paper summarises previous researches about trust of users on eSystems
                        and discussed how to use different methods to improve the end-users' acceptance of the eSystems.

                     <h3>II.FINDING/DISCUSSION</h3>
                     <p>Naelah Al-Dabbous, Anwar Al-Yatama and Kassem Salehfinding pointed out eight aspects that affect
                        the credibility of the eSystems, such as privacy, communication and information, technology,
                        personal service and so on[1]. Among them, technology, privacy, communication and information
                        are the areas where users pay the most attention. They designed some questionnaires to access
                        end-users to obtain accurate information about some factors that affect the use of eSystems by
                        end-users. Therefore, improving end-user trust in eSystems has become the main point.</p>
                     <p>One of the ways to improve end-user confidence is to strengthen the privacy protection of
                        end-users, Johan Mazel, Richard Garnier, Kensuke Fukuda compared a series of online privacy
                        protection technologies in their research. They believe that Third-party trackers are currently
                        the most threatening user privacy. After analysing the current online privacy protection
                        technologies, their research shows that Request Policy Continued and Noscript technology is the
                        most effective privacy protection method at present[3]. But for end-users, it is still
                        challenging to achieve good results through settings the protect plugins or applications.</p>
                     <p>Another measure to increase user trust is to enhance the security of the system. At present,
                        Hypertext Transfer Protocol Security (HTTPS) is increasingly used. HTTPS uses SSL / TLS
                        encryption to create a secure channel on the user side and server-side, which can prevent
                        eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Richard Thomchick and Tonia San
                        Nicolas-Rocca conducted relevant tests on the security of HTTPS in their research. They
                        concluded that the combination of using HTTPS and restricting the use of cookies could
                        significantly enhance the safety of the eSystems[4].</p>
                     <p>In my opinion, it is not enough to meet the functional needs of end-users but also needs to
                        improve users' trust for eSystems is also another essential part of works. By increasing the
                        privacy and security of eSystems through a variety of technical means such as HTTPS and Noscript
                        technology, it is possible to increase the end-users' trust in eSystems, thereby attracting more
                        users to use eSystems.</p>

                     <h3>III.CONCLUSION </h3>
                     <p>The purpose of this paper is to discuss how to enhance the security, privacy, and reliability of
                        eSystems in conjunction with existing research. Using different kinds of technology to improve
                        safety and protect user's privacy, we can improve user's acceptance of the eSystems so that we
                        can let more and more users use eSystems. In other words, only by meeting the needs of end-users
                        for security and privacy can we further deepen users' trust in the eSystems.
